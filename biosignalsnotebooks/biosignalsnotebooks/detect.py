    acquisition.
detect_emg_activations
    In this function a single threshold algorithm is used for identifying the begin and end of each
    muscular activation period.
    EMG signal was simplified before the "sample by sample" threshold check, through smoothing and
    application of Teager Kaiser Energy Operator (TKEO).

    Python implementation of Burst detection algorithm using Teager Kaiser Energy Operator.

    -----------
    Description
    -----------
    Activation events in EMG readings correspond to an increase of muscular activity, namely, from inaction to action.

        the more smoothed is the signal.

    threshold_level : number
        Specification of the single threshold position, used for distinguishing between activation
        (above) and inactivation samples (below).

    time_units : boolean
        If True this function will return the Burst begin and end positions in seconds.

    volts : boolean
        If True, then the conversion of raw units to mV will be done. Resolution need to be

        signal.

    out : bursts begin (ndarray), bursts end (ndarray)
        Begin and end of bursts (sample number or time instant in seconds).

        It is returned the smoothed EMG signal (after the processing steps intended to simplify the
