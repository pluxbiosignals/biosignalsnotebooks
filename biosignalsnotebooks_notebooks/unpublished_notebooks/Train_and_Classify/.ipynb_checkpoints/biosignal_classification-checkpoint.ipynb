For example, in retail, it may be used to aggregate a set of customers that exhibit similar shopping patterns in order to send directed advertisement to them.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Semi-Supervised Learning</strong> - Learning the internal structure of a given dataset with some knowledge about it. It is usually used in cases where it is possible to distinguish classes from datasets without the need of labelling every class, which is an expensive work. For example, it may be used in anomaly detection scenarios, where the number of normal instances is usually immensely higher than the anomalous instances. A concrete example is that of aircraft failure detection, in which we know the normal functioning of the system, but we lack in anomalies because it may be too expensive or rare to happen (p.e. engine malfunction). In this cases, the normal instances are labelled, but the anomalous ones are not.</li>\n",

For example, there are databases of ECG signals that include high number of arrhythmias, where every heartbeat is labelled by the type of arrhythmia or if it is normal.</li>\n",
